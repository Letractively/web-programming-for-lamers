                            <p>Cross the Line was created by young university students, who realized that youth in 
                            Latinamerica is ready to be active and needs only to have accurate and up to date information to do so. </p>
                                    
                            <p>The project began in September 2010, after the Latin America Youth Summit took place in Río de Janerio, Brazil. 
                            This event was organized and led by the Global Change Makers inititive, a British Council project, designed to 
                            impulse and provide the necessary tools for youth to take action in solving the most important problems in their countries and regions. </p>

                            <h5>What we do</h5>                     
							<p>Cross the Line has been designed to enable young people to “Cross the Line” between the ideal of doing 
                            something to change reality, and actually doing it. By using this web page, the user will find a very well 
                            constructed data base, in which they will be able to match their interests, concerns and time availability, 
                            with causes or non governmental organizations who seek volunteers to perform and get involved in particular projects. </p>
                            
							<p>Youth is by definition, the time when a young person constructs who they are going to be in the future, they decide 
                            their area of expertise, from which they decide what to study and what university to attend. This is a crucial time for 
                            a young person, and it’s exactly at this moment, when they need to get out there, and see reality. 
                            Acknowledge their communities, learn about the social and economic problems that force millions of families into poverty, 
                            and actually doing something about it.</p>
                            
                            <p>We believe that young people aren´t the future, they are the present. </p>
